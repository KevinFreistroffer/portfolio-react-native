  "Hi, my name is Kevin Freistroffer. I'm 36 years and have been developing for 10+ years. I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with React and Angular on the front end, NodeJS and MongoDB on the server side, Dart and mobile development with Flutter. I enjoy, prefer and need to work with a team of other developers to progress and am looking forward to joining a team, in an Agile methodology, utilizing tools such as Jira, to develop stories and features, and to fix bugs, while learning new technologies, strategies, thought processes to develop and incorporate into my daily routines, and to be led by the team and to lead when needed.";
